# FEUP-AEDA
Repository created to host projects elaborated in the Algorithms and Data Structures course

The Course focuses in the implementation of several algorithms and data structures in C++.

**Everything developed during this course was done with the help of my partner** [Jo√£o Ribeiro](http://github.com/Fujicsso)

## Exercises

This folder stores exercises solved to gain some practical insight on how some algorithms and data strucures work. They are divided in Theoretical-Practical (TP) classes.

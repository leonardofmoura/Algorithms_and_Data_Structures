# FEUP-AEDA
Repository created to host projects elaborated in the Algorithms and Data Structures course

The Course focuses in the implementation of several algorithms and data structures in C++.

**Everything developed during this course was done with the help of my partner** [Jo√£o Ribeiro](http://github.com/Fujicsso)

## Exercises

This folder stores exercises solved to gain some practical insight on how some algorithms and data structures work. They are divided in Theoretical-Practical (TP) classes.

- **TP1:**Cute C++ test environment, class basics and constant members 
- **TP2:**Subclass Inheritance, Polymorphism and operator overloading
- **TP3:**Polymorphism, static members and documentation

**Note**:If find some mistake in this readme or any other part of this repo, feel free to tell me about it!

**Note 2**:Some aspects of the code are written in Portuguese because that was the structure of the course

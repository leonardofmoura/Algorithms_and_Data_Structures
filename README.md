# FEUP-AEDA
Repository created to host projects elaborated in the Algorithms and Data Structures course

The Course focuses in the implementation of several algorithms and data structures in C++.

## Exercises

This folder stores exercises solved to gain some practical insight on how some algorithms and data structures work. They are divided in Theoretical-Practical (TP) classes.

- **TP1:** Cute C++ test environment, class basics and constant members 
- **TP2:** Subclass Inheritance, Polymorphism and operator overloading
- **TP3:** Polymorphism, static members and documentation
- **TP6:** Lists
- **TP7:** Stacks and Queues
- **TP8:** Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees
- **TP10:** Hash Tables
- **TP11:** Priority Queues

## Tests

Some old tests I solved as practice challenges.

## Project 

Project developed during the course with the goal of applying data data structures. The project provides a system to manage different faculties within a university, storing and managing different types of information.
